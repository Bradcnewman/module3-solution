        Kung pao chicken has a lot going for it. The Chinese takeout favorite boasts tender chicken, crisp veggies, crunchy roasted peanuts, and a spicy, savory sauce coating each and every bite. With a few basic stir-frying techniques, you can make this satisfying dish at home anytime the craving strikes. Here’s how to do it.
        What Is Kung Pao Chicken, and Where Did It Originate? Kung pao chicken originated in Sichuan, although you can now find it all over China. The traditional version is a combination of chicken, peanuts, leeks, fried Sichuan peppercorns, and dried chiles, but the version that’s become popular in Chinese-American restaurants (think: P.F. Chang’s and Panda Express) is milder, and features a wider array of vegetables — sometimes bell peppers and onions, other times chunks of zucchini. Our version here takes inspiration from the latter, calling for easy-to-find ingredients and pantry staples to keep it simple and weeknight-friendly.
